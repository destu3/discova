    "overview": "Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.<br><br>Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.<br><br>Note: The last episode received a pre-airing in Tokyo, Marunouchi Piccadilly 1 theater. TV broadcast took place after midnight, a few hours later.",

Thrust into a maelstrom of battles and events that he does not understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the depths of his own inner resources for the courage and strength to not only fight, but to survive, or risk losing everything.<br><br>Note: The 2003 Renewal of Evangelion is the final remastered version. It includes:<br><br>* The original TV series, episodes 1-20<br><br>* The Director`s Cut of episodes 21-24 of the original TV series<br><br>* Death(True)^2, released on the ninth disc with the label of Revival of Evangelion<br><br>* The End of Evangelion, released on the tenth disc, with the label Evangelion – The Feature Film",

Once, a great fire that destroyed more than a hundred homes took the lives of his biological parents. He was then adopted by the man who saved him from that inferno, a man who called himself a magus; however, after a few years, that man, too, died. Shirou was left with a home, the dream to become a superhero, and some extremely limited knowledge of magecraft, the art practised in secret by magi all over the world. Now, unbeknownst to him, the city he lives in, Fuyuki City, is to become the place where a great war will be fought in secret by magi like the man who adopted him.<br><br>For this great war, seven magi shall gather together in Fuyuki. Each magus becomes a Master, and each Master summons a Servant, a spirit of a mighty hero of the past that, due to their almost almighty powers in life and to the faith people have put in them through the times, ascend to a higher level of existence, outside of time. Together, Master and Servant fight against the other teams for the possession of the Holy Grail, a relic said to be almighty and grant any wish, no matter how great. However, in order to allow the winning Master and Servant to be granted one wish each, all other teams must be defeated, and the enemy Servants annihilated.

To better hide the identity, the Servants are usually referred to by their classes, Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, and Assassin.<br><br>One night, Shirou witnesses a fight between two servants, Archer and Lancer.
